# Data Wrangling
```{r}
#Read data into
D1 <- read.csv("hudk4050-classes.csv", header = TRUE)

#Merge First.name and Last.name variables to create unique ID because we have duplicate first and last names in the class
D1 <- tidyr::unite(D1, Name, Last.name, First.name, sep = " ", remove = TRUE)

#Reshape data to create a "course" variable (you will get a warning because there are missing cells)
D2 <- tidyr::gather(D1, course.label, course, Course1, Course2, Course3, Course4, Course5, na.rm = TRUE, convert = FALSE)
#or 
#D_long <- tidyr::gather(D1, CourseNo., "course", 2:6)

#Remove the "course.label" variable
D2 <- dplyr::select(D2, Name, course)
#or
#D2 <- D_long[c(1,3)]

#Remove rows indicating HUDK4050 because all students are in this course and it will overwhelm the graph
D2 <- dplyr::filter(D2, course > 0, course != "HUDK4050")

#Add a variable to be used to count the courses
D2$Count <- 1

#Reshape the data to create a person x class matrix
D3 <- tidyr::spread(D2, course, Count)

#This was a bit of a trick, for the matrix command to work the row names needed to changed from an indice (1,2,3,etc) to the student names 
row.names(D3) <- D3$Name
D3$Name <- NULL

D3 <- ifelse(is.na(D3), 0, 1)

#Convert the data from data frame format to matrix format so it can be transposed
D4 <- as.matrix(D3)

#Transpose matrix to produce a person x person matrix
D5 <- D4 %*% t(D4) #to get the number of courses these people are doing together
diag(D5) <- NA #to remove the diagnal - the number of courses a person is doing with self. Redundant
#Transpose. The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix whose rows are the columns of the original. (This makes the columns of the new matrix the rows of the original)
```
# Graphing
```{r}
g <- graph.adjacency(D5,mode="undirected")

plot(g,layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold, vertex.size=6)

```
# Centrality
```{r}
#Calculate the degree centrality of the nodes, showing who has the most connections
degree(g)

#Calculate the betweeness centrality, showing how many "shortest paths" pass through each node. This turns out to be uniformative for this graph as there are a bunch of people who are almost equally connected and a bunch of people who are unconnected.
betweenness(g)
```
